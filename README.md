Hello! I am Rafael Mafra, 32 years old.
Student of Python which I am passionate about and programming enthusiastic. At Pitagoras College (2012/2016-Minas Gerais,Brazil), the automation engineering program gave me the chance to learn Algorithms & Data Structures, Programming Logic and C++ where I found my passion for programming, since then I have been studying Python by reading many books, watching online classes and working on some projects.

This year, I moved to England to start working on my career in new place, looking for new offers, challenges and an opportunity to start develop professionally as an programmer, assistant or internal.
